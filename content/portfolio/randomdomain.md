description: Fun site that brute-force scans random domains until it finds one that responds

A fun site/webapp that I created. Takes a list of domain extensions (com/net/org etc.) and a large English dictionary and combines them together until it finds a site that responds, and returns the domain to the user. You can find and explore some sites that you'd never see otherwise.

Built on Azure with an Azure Function (C#) for the backend and Blob Storage/CDN for static frontend app (VueJS) hosting
