            <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
            <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer and 'Web &amp; Mobile Development (Bsc)' graduate from the University of
                the West of Scotland. I'm currently living in Cleethorpes, UK.</p>
            <p>I currently work for Ofgem, the UK government's 'Office of Gas and Electricity Markets' regulator, working in a hybrid capacity as a principal software engineer
                working with modern web technologies including C#/ASP.NET (.NET 8) following agile &amp; DevOps
                methodology.</p>
            <p>In my free-time I like to work on pet-projects and travel (mainly by rail), creating video content &amp;
                taking photographs. I also love listening to music &amp; attending live events.</p>
