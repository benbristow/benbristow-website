My dad started a thing on Facebook where he'd post a picture every Tuesday morning of the family dog with an amusing quote. I thought it'd be amusing to purchase the domain and make a site of it.

Originally created using WordPress, I migrated it over to use my own custom Ruby on Rails headless CMS that's currently powering the content on this very portfolio page you're on right now.

The site is now powered with C#/ASP.NET Core 3.0 with Razor pages

Check it out every Tuesday for a fun post!
