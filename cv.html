                    <p class="lead">Developer, East Kilbride, Scotland, November 2017 - June 2019</p>
                    <p>
                        I entered the business as a winter intern and after impressing management &amp; my colleagues I
                        was swiftly
                        hired as a full-time developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked primarily as a front-end developer and worked on a wide variety of multi-faceted B2C
                        &amp; B2B
                        travel e-commerce sites for high-profile
                        clients including Barrhead Travel, Co-Operative Travel, Sandals Resorts &amp; MSC Cruise Lines.
                        Development
                        was primary achieved using standard JavaScript, jQuery &amp;
                        the Mozilla Nunjucks templating library wrapped with a custom framework &amp; 'Page Builder'
                        CMS. During my
                        time at Traveltek I was able to consult into the migration of
                        using more modern, faster and maintainable tools such as using React for building web
                        applications with
                        re-usable, contained &amp; testable components and using Git/GitHub for
                        version control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At times I was asked to do backend development, primarily integrating supplier XML/JSON APIs
                        into the search
                        & booking engine developed with Perl. This was version controlled
                        using Subversion (SVN).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I collaborated heavily with both internal &amp; external customers providing support through our
                        internal
                        Jira installation &amp; also in-person with project
                        management and support (Customer Success) teams.

                    <p>
                        During my time at Traveltek I was awarded with a 'Club Elite' award, representing myself as one
                        of the top
                        10 best performing employees in the business voted by my peers &amp; colleagues.
