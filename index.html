      <h2>Hello world!</h2>
  
      <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer and 'Web & Mobile Development (Bsc)' graduate from the University of the West of Scotland (Paisley Campus). I was originally born in Grimsby, England and I'm a big Grimsby Town Football Club fan!</p>
      <p>I currently work for Ofgem, the UK government's 'Office of Gas and Electricity Markets' regulator based in their office in Glasgow City Centre, working in a hybrid capacity as a principal software engineer working with modern web technologies including C#/ASP.NET (.NET 7) following agile & DevOps methodology.</p>
      <p>In my free-time I like to work on pet-projects and travel (mainly by rail), creating video content & taking photographs. I also love listening to music & attending live events.</p>
